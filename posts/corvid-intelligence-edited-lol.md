# Corvid Intelligence: Why Crows Are Smarter Than You Think

"Bird brain" is meant as an insult. But if you're comparing someone to a crow, raven, or jay, you might actually be giving them a compliment. Corvids — the family that includes crows, ravens, magpies, and jays — demonstrate cognitive abilities that rival great apes and, in some cases, young children.

## They Make and Use Tools

New Caledonian crows don't just use tools — they manufacture them. In the wild, they craft hooked sticks from branches to extract insects from tree bark. In laboratory settings, a crow named Betty famously bent a piece of wire into a hook to retrieve food from a tube, despite never having seen wire before.

This isn't trial and error. It's problem-solving with foresight.

## They Pass the Aesop's Fable Test

Remember the fable where a thirsty crow drops stones into a pitcher to raise the water level? Scientists recreated this scenario, and crows passed with flying colors. They understood that dropping objects would displace water, chose solid objects over hollow ones, and even selected the correct tube when given multiple options.

This demonstrates causal reasoning — understanding that one action leads to a specific outcome.

## They Remember Faces (and Hold Grudges)

Researchers at the University of Washington wore masks while capturing and banding crows. Years later, crows still scolded people wearing those specific masks — even though the original researchers were long gone. More remarkably, crows that weren't even born during the original capture learned to scold the masks from other crows.

They're not just remembering. They're teaching.

## They Plan for the Future

Western scrub-jays cache food in hundreds of locations and remember what they stored, where they stored it, and when — adjusting their retrieval based on which foods spoil fastest. In experiments, they also demonstrated the ability to plan for future needs, storing food in locations where they knew they'd be hungry later, even when currently full.

This suggests episodic-like memory and future planning — abilities once thought uniquely human.

## They Understand Social Dynamics

Ravens engage in tactical deception. They'll pretend to hide food in one spot while secretly caching it elsewhere if they suspect they're being watched. They track who saw them hide food and will re-cache items if a potential thief was observing.

They also form alliances, console distressed companions, and appear to understand what others can and cannot see — a form of "theory of mind."

## They Have Regional Dialects

Crow calls aren't universal. Different populations develop distinct vocalizations, essentially dialects, that are passed down through generations. Young crows learn their local "language" from adults, and crows from different regions may not fully understand each other.

This cultural transmission of learned behavior is something we typically associate with humans, whales, and a handful of other species.

Next time someone calls you a bird brain, ask them which bird. If it's a corvid, take it as a compliment.
