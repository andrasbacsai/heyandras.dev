# Fun Bird Facts You Probably Didn't Know

Birds are everywhere, yet most of us know surprisingly little about them. Here are some facts that might change how you see these feathered creatures.

## Crows Remember Faces

Crows can recognize and remember human faces for years. If you wrong a crow, it will not only remember you but also tell other crows about you. Researchers at the University of Washington found that crows would scold specific people who had captured them — even years later.

## Pigeons Are Math Whizzes

Pigeons can learn abstract numerical rules. Studies have shown they can rank images by the number of objects in them, a skill previously thought to be exclusive to primates.

## The Arctic Tern's Epic Journey

The Arctic tern migrates from Arctic to Antarctic and back every year — roughly 44,000 miles. Over its lifetime, a single bird can travel the equivalent of three round trips to the moon.

## Flamingos Aren't Pink

Flamingos are born grey. Their pink color comes entirely from their diet of brine shrimp and algae, which contain carotenoid pigments. Zoo flamingos are often fed supplements to maintain their color.

## Owls Can't Move Their Eyeballs

Owls have tube-shaped eyes that are fixed in their sockets. To look around, they have to turn their entire head — which they can rotate up to 270 degrees.

## Hummingbirds Are the Only Birds That Fly Backwards

Their unique ball-and-socket shoulder joint allows them to rotate their wings 180 degrees, enabling backward flight, hovering, and even flying upside down.

## A Group of Flamingos is Called a "Flamboyance"

And a group of crows is a "murder." A group of owls? A "parliament."
