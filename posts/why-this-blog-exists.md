# Why this blog exists?

I am currently working on the next-gen version of Coolify, v5, where I would like to make something big (post on <a href="https://x.com/heyandras/status/1932816658596573599">X</a>).

When I started to do Coolify, I "documented" my journey on social media, which was a lot of fun, but I want to have a more permanent place. 

> So it is never late to start a blog. :)

In this blog I will share the whole process of building it. I will do things that I never did before, or have no idea how to do.

So this blog will contain all my struggles, mistakes, and learnings and hopefully wins.

If you would like to follow my journey, you can do so by subscribing to the <a href="/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> or follow me on any of the social media platforms (list is in the footer).

## Why the look?
Simple. I like minimalism and simplicity. This works everywhere and I can focus on the content.

The code (generated with AI in 30 mins) is available on <a href="https://github.com/andrasbacsai/heyandras.dev">GitHub</a>.

The images are generated with AI.

The content is hand written. :)
