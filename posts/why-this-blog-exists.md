# Why this blog exists?

I am currently working on the next-gen version of Coolify, v5, where I would like to make something big (post on <a href="https://x.com/heyandras/status/1932816658596573599">X</a>).

When I started to work on Coolify, I "documented" my journey on social media. It was a lot of fun, but I want to have a more permanent place. 

> Tt is never late to start a blog. :)

Here I will share the whole process of figuring out how to build it. I will do things that I never did before, or have no idea how to do. You will see all my struggles, mistakes, and learnings and hopefully wins.

It has an RSS feed, but make sure you follow me on one of the social media platforms (list is in the footer).

## Why this blog looks so simple?
I like minimalism and simplicity. This works on every device and I can focus on the content.

The code (generated with AI in 30 mins) is available on <a href="https://github.com/andrasbacsai/heyandras.dev">GitHub</a>.

The images are generated with AI.

The content is hand written. :)
